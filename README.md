## State Management

- Used Redux Toolkit to reduce boilerplate code and takes advantage of the [Immer library](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/usage/immer-reducers) to improve code readability.
- Used [Uncontrolled Form](https://react.dev/learn/sharing-state-between-components#controlled-and-uncontrolled-components) for form handling.
